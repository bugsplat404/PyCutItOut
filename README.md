## !Disclaimer!

This is a small, random, brainstorming, one-evening-project so don't take it to serious :)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. Then, install the necessary dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bugsplat404/PyCutItOut.git
    cd PyCutItOut
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Then, install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the App

Run the Python script to launch the app:

```bash
python main.py
```


## Running it as .exe

For convenience reasons, using it as .exe without dependencies comes in handy. That's why I didn't split it into multiple files :)

```bash
pyinstaller --name CutItOut --onefile --windowed main.py
```


Happy cutting! üé•‚úÇÔ∏è‚ú®
